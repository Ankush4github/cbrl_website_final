abstract = {Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are clinically distinct but may share common molecular mechanisms. This study used integrative bioinformatics to identify 23 significantly dysregulated genes common to both conditions. Key regulatory microRNAs (hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-let-7g-5p) and macrophage-associated pathways were implicated. Interferon alpha/beta signaling emerged as a central shared pathway between PTB and GERD. Five hub genes (MYL9, OASL, ACTA2, DDX60L, and DDX60) were identified as common between these two conditions and their expressions were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Drug repurposing analysis identified ribavirin as a promising candidate targeting the hub gene OASL, supported by a favorable binding affinity (−6.6 kcal/mol) and acceptable ADMET properties. These findings pave the way for understanding the molecular overlap between PTB and GERD and for developing targeted therapeutic strategies.}

Developmental process regulatory HOX proteins (HOXA4,7,10,11) have been extensively studied to chalk reproductive immunology-related diseases with lesser-known effects of HOXA9, HOXA13, and their targets therein. Hence, functional enrichment and differential expression analysis of HOXA9 and HOXA13 targets were conducted to identify immunological markers in RIF and PE. 517 common transcription factors (CTFs) of HOXA9 and A13 were retrieved and subjected to an in-depth bioinformatic analysis to determine different associated diseases. This was followed by pathway enrichment and protein–protein interaction analysis by DAVID and Cytoscape, respectively along with depicting structural characteristics and interaction dynamics. Overlapping CTFs in RIF and PE were identified from microarray datasets (GSE103465, GSE26787 for RIF and GSE43942, GSE10588 for PE) from GEO database to determine differentially expressed genes. Validation by qRT-PCR on eutopic endometrial samples (n = 5) obtained during window of implantation and placental tissues (n = 5) revealed significant upregulation of HOXA9 and HOXA13 with dysregulated expression of CTFs (PARVA, TFAP2A, and PHTF2) in RIF and PE. Our findings revealed common potential immune characteristics of RIF and PE which may enrich the study of related pathogenic mechanisms.}

The contribution of MoS2 as sensing material is substantiated in the context of density functional theory formalism. The molecular modelling of MoS2 and glucose interaction is elucidated through the theoretical estimation of non-covalent interactions and charge density difference plots. The charge transfer phenomenon during the oxidation of glucose molecule in electrochemical experiments is verified through electronic band structure analysis and frontier orbital theory. The electrochemical responses indicate that the sensor exhibits an average accuracy of nearly 96%, with a quantification limit of 100 nM. Furthermore, the chronoamperometric measurements highlight the superior sensitivity of the device in presence of various perturbing molecules. The obtained DPV responses were integrated with a robust machine learning-driven standalone app GluQuantify. This app precisely predicts the glucose concentrations in serum samples. The utilization of GluQuantify substantially elevates the overall accuracy of the sensing platform to 99% and automates the detection process. The application also enhances the resolution of the sensor to 0.01 µM, which mitigates the sensor resolution-related issues in manual estimation.}

Women with cervical anomalies or trauma can benefit from clinical cervicovaginal repair using constructs rich in site specific ECM. In this study, complete human cervix decellularization was achieved using a modified perfusion-based stir bench top decellularization method. This was followed by physico-chemical processes including perfusion of ionic agents, enzymatic treatment and washing using detergent solutions for a duration of 10–12 d. Histopathological analysis, as well as DNA quantification confirmed the efficacy of the decellularization process. Tissue ultrastructure integrity was preserved and the same was validated via scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies. Biochemical analysis and structural characterizations like Fourier transform infrared, Raman spectroscopy of decellularized tissues demonstrated preservation of important proteins, crucial growth factors, collagen, and glycosaminoglycans. In vitro studies, using THP-1 and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cells, demonstrated macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 and vascular functional genes enhancement, respectively, when treated with decellularized human cervical matrix (DHCp). Crosslinked DHC scaffolds were recellularized with site specific human cervical epithelial cells and HUVEC, showing non-cytotoxic cell viability and enhanced proliferation. Furthermore, DHC scaffolds showed immunomodulatory effects in vivo on small rodent model via upregulation of M2 macrophage genes as compared to decellularized rat cervix matrix scaffolds (DRC). DHC scaffolds underwent neo-vascularization followed by ECM remodeling with enhanced tissue integration.}

abstract = {Background
This study aims to identify metabolomic signatures in uterine fluid of women with idiopathic recurrent spontaneous miscarriage (IRSM) during window of implantation (WOI). Also, glucose transporters GLUT3 and GLUT4 and proteins of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in endometrial tissue are assessed.
Methods
Paired uterine fluid and endometrial biopsies were collected during WOI from women with IRSM (n = 24) and healthy women with azoospermic male partners as controls (n = 15). NMR metabolomics was used to identify the dysregulated metabolites in uterine fluid of IRSM women. Additionally, proteins and glucose transporters were investigated in the endometrial tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting.
Results
Uterine fluid metabolomics indicated eleven metabolites to be significantly downregulated in IRSM. While expression levels of PI3K (p85), PI3K (p110), p-Akt (Thr308), p-Akt (Ser473), GLUT3 and GLUT4 were significantly downregulated in endometrial tissue of these women, p-IKK α/β (Ser176/180) and p-NFkBp65 (Ser536) were significantly increased.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that dysregulation of PI3K/Akt pathway in the uterine microenvironment could be a likely cause of endometrial dysfunction, thereby affecting implantation. Further studies on the downstream effects of the Akt signaling pathway in-vitro for improved understanding of the Akt-mediated cellular responses in IRSM is, therefore, warranted.}

The present study aims to use a bioinformatics approach to identify and validate hypoxia-associated gene signatures in COPD-PH patients. Additionally, hypoxia-related inflammatory profile is also explored in these patients. Microarray dataset obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in a hypoxic PH mice model. The top three hub genes identified were further validated in COPD-PH patients, with chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9) and CXCL12 showing significant changes in comparison to healthy controls. Furthermore, multiplexed analysis of 10 inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18 and IL-21 was also performed. These markers showed significant changes in COPD-PH patients as compared to controls. They also exhibited the ability to differentially diagnose COPD-PH patients in comparison to COPD. Additionally, IL-6 and IL-17 showed significant positive correlation with systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). This study is the first report to assess the levels of CXCL9 and CXCL12 in COPD-PH patients and also explores their link with the inflammatory profile of these patients. Our findings could be extended to better understand the underlying disease mechanism and possibly used for tailoring therapies exclusive for the disease.}

  abstract  = {A comprehensive knowledge on systems biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is crucial for differential diagnosis of COVID-19. Interestingly, the radiological and pathological features of COVID-19 mimic that of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), another pulmonary fibrotic phenotype. This motivated us to explore the overlapping pathophysiology of COVID-19 and HP, if any, and using a systems biology approach. Two datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE147507 and GSE150910) and common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for both diseases identified. Fourteen common DEGs, significantly altered in both diseases, were found to be implicated in complement activation and growth factor activity. A total of five microRNAs (hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-16-5p, and hsa-miR-34b-5p) and five transcription factors (KLF6, ZBTB7A, ELF1, NFIL3, and ZBT33) exhibited highest interaction with these common genes. Next, C3, CFB, MMP-9, and IL1A were identified as common hub genes for both COVID-19 and HP. Finally, these top-ranked genes (hub genes) were evaluated using random forest classifier to discriminate between the disease and control group (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] vs. controls, and HP vs. controls). This supervised machine learning approach demonstrated 100\% and 87.6\% accuracy in differentiating COVID-19 from controls, and HP from controls, respectively. These findings provide new molecular leads that inform COVID-19 and HP diagnostics and therapeutics research and innovation.}

In-situ deposited polyaniline-based paper device maintains emeraldine salt form while it is exposed to acidic pH and converts to emeraldine base when it is subjected to alkaline pH solutions. These structural changes at acidic and alkaline pH are validated experimentally by Raman spectra. Furthermore, the Raman spectra computed from density functional theory are validated with the experimental spectra. The changes in the theoretical energy band gap of polyaniline obtained from first principle calculations were correlated with the changes in the experimental impedimetric response of the sensor after exposure to acidic and alkaline solutions. Finally, the impedimetric responses were used to predict urine pH through a machine learning based smart and interactive web application. Different machine learning based regression models were implemented to acquire the best possible outcome. Gradient Boosting Regressor with least square loss model was selected as it showed lowest mean square, mean absolute, and root mean square error than other models. The smart sensing platform successfully predicts the unknown pH of urine samples with an average accuracy of more than 98%. The locally deployed smart web app can be accessed within a local area network by the end-user, which holds promise towards effective detection of urinary pH.}

Herein, a multi-layered biodegradable stent is fabricated using a homogeneous blend of silk fibroin with polycaprolactone using hexafluoroisopropanol as a common solution. Briefly, a concentric cylinder of 3D honeycomb layer is sandwiched within electrospun sheets for fixing at the cervico-uterine junction to pave the way of cervical reconstruction. An average length of 40 mm with 3 mm diameter is fabricated for the hybrid stent design. SEM evidences an evenly distributed pore architecture of the electrospun layer, and mechanical characterization of stent reveals a tensile strength of 1.7 ± 0.2 MPa, with a Young’s modulus of 5.9 ± 0.1 MPa. Physico-chemical characterization confirms the presence of silk fibroin and poly caprolactone within the engineered stent. Following 14 days of pepsin enzymatic degradation, 18\% degradation and a contact angle measurement of 97° are observed. In vitro cytocompatibility studies are performed using site-specific primary human cervical squamous, columnar epithelial cells, and human endometrial stromal cells. The study demonstrates non-cytotoxic cells’ viability (no significant toxicity), improved cell anchoring, adherence among the stent layers, and proliferation in the 3D microenvironment. Furthermore, in vivo subcutaneous studies in the rodent model indicate that the implanted stent undergoes constructive remodeling, neo-tissue creation, neo-vasculature formation, and re-epithelialization while maintaining patency for 2 months.}

abstract = {Airborne particulate matter (PM) is known to be associated with various chronic human ailments, however, precise underlying molecular mechanisms remains elusive. Based on the place of residence and amount of PM exposure, the study groups were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group. Different parameters related to oxidative DNA damage and repair, integrated stress response, mito-nuclear crosstalk, mitochondrial biogenesis, functioning and epigenetic machinery were assessed. The results of our pilot study showed that in comparison to the low-risk group, the levels of mitochondrial stress and oxidative DNA damage were significantly higher in the high-risk group. In addition, the upregulated expression levels of OMA1, DELE1, and HRI genes in the high-risk group confirmed the onset of an integrated stress response. These disturbances in the mitochondrial genome were further found to be associated with the vital processes of mitochondrial biogenesis. The high-risk group reported significant alterations in the mtDNA copy number and expression of mitochondrial fission and fusion genes. Importantly, we also observed higher expression levels of mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM, a key regulator of mtDNA replication and transcription in the high-risk group. Moreover, these changes were accompanied by the disturbances in the expression of TET genes and levels of mtDNA methylation. This impaired mtDNA methylation profile further correlated with the disturbed activity of electron chain complexes and expression of the mitochondria function genes in the high-risk group. Altogether, our observations provide vital molecular insights of the integrated mitoepigenetic signalling network in the airborne PM exposed individuals, hitherto unreported.}

In-situ deposited polyaniline-based paper device maintains emeraldine salt form while it is exposed to acidic pH and converts to emeraldine base when it is subjected to alkaline pH solutions. These structural changes at acidic and alkaline pH are validated experimentally by Raman spectra. Furthermore, the Raman spectra computed from density functional theory are validated with the experimental spectra. The changes in the theoretical energy band gap of polyaniline obtained from first principle calculations were correlated with the changes in the experimental impedimetric response of the sensor after exposure to acidic and alkaline solutions. Finally, the impedimetric responses were used to predict urine pH through a machine learning based smart and interactive web application. Different machine learning based regression models were implemented to acquire the best possible outcome. Gradient Boosting Regressor with least square loss model was selected as it showed lowest mean square, mean absolute, and root mean square error than other models. The smart sensing platform successfully predicts the unknown pH of urine samples with an average accuracy of more than 98%. The locally deployed smart web app can be accessed within a local area network by the end-user, which holds promise towards effective detection of urinary pH.}

abstract="Cancer is a major global health burden and accounts for the second-highest mortality rate around the world. Despite significant advances in cancer research, minimal/noninvasive diagnostic strategies for early detection remain elusive, leading to delays in therapeutic intervention and affecting the overall survival chances. Most cancers exhibit no specific symptoms in the early stages. However, upon metastasis to nearby organs, certain symptoms become prominent and detectable. Conventional tissue biopsy performed in these cancers is not only invasive but is also limited in its diagnostic efficacy by the presence of tumor heterogeneity. In this regard, liquid biopsy has brought a revolution in early cancer diagnosis. Extracellular vesicles are among some of the reliable biomarkers for liquid biopsy. Recent advancements in technology have laid a strong foundation in understanding the role of extracellular vesicles in cancer progression. In this review, we briefly present the multifarious roles of extracellular vesicles toward an accurate cancer diagnosis. Moreover, the recent progress in extracellular vesicle liquid biopsy biosensors is also discussed, with a focus on electrochemical biosensors. Lastly, the requisite measures to be taken to improve the performance of the existing biosensors, with an aim of bringing them to the commercial point-of-care (POC) market, are concisely summarized.",

The overlapping features shared by these two diseases often make differential diagnosis difficult to achieve, leading to misdiagnosis of these patients. Both asthma and COPD are associated with chronic inflammation of the airways which is perpetuated by the interplay between immunological mediators. The crucial role played by these mediators make them attractive targets for disease diagnosis. The present study investigates the immunological mediator profile in these patients as compared with controls. Further, a potential biomarker for the development of a sensing platform is identified. Multiplexed analysis of 8 commonly studied immunological markers (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, TGF-β, IFN-γ, MCP-1 and NGAL) in serum showed distinct dysregulation pattern, with IL-13 showing the highest potential for differential diagnosis. An impedimetric self-assembled monolayer (SAM) based sensor for detecting IL-13 is developed to distinguish between asthma and COPD. The device shows reliable output with high accuracy and sensitivity towards the detection of IL-13.}

Rapid digestibility of most starch rich foods boosts up the blood glucose level. Thus, the present study put forward an attempt to curtail the rapid digestibility of starch rich semolina flour by increasing its resistant starch content through enzymatic process. The enzymatically modified semolina flour (MS) was compared with its native counterpart (NS) on grounds of their digestibility pattern, biochemical and functional properties. A rise in resistant starch content by 9.3 ± 1.6 %, amylose content by 10.9 ± 1.2 %, crystallinity by 10.4 % and the drop in readily digestible starch by 11.9 ± 1.4 % and oil absorption by 2.1 ± 0.3 g/g were observed in MS.

The expression of three metabolites{,} i.e.{,} lactate{,} pyruvate{,} and proline{,} was found to be significantly altered in all three biofluids. The potential of differential diagnosis based on these three metabolites was investigated by including a group of patients with sarcoidosis{,} which is another type of granulomatous ILD. In addition{,} differentially expressed transcriptomic fingerprints in blood samples were identified by analyzing a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The transcriptomics analysis of these microarray-based data revealed 59 genes to be significantly dysregulated in patients with HP. Over representation analysis of the metabolites and genes of interest was performed using IMPaLA (Integrated Molecular Pathway Level Analysis) version 12. Integrated analysis of serum metabolite signatures and blood gene expression suggests dysregulation of PI3K–AKT signaling and TCA cycle pathways in these patients. This preliminary study is a step towards better understanding of the pathogenesis of HP by identification of differentially expressed metabolites and transcriptomic fingerprints. These molecular signatures may be explored as diagnostic markers for differentiating HP from other lung diseases."}

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method has been employed to measure the Faradic redox responses of different concentrations of A1BG. Charge transfer resistances measured from the Nyquist plots are linearly related to the logarithmic change of antigen concentration with a 1 ng/mL detection limit. The sensor requires a low sample volume of 50 μL with a resolution of 4 ng/mL. The specificity and sensitivity of the device are also tested with different interfering proteins. A robust classification model is also implemented for detection of A1BG, which could be useful in precise decision-making for end users.}

In most cases, such fabricated device results in direct contact with the analyte solution on the surface of the electrode during electrical detection and leads to high electrical double layer capacitance. In this work, we have focused to reduce the double layer capacitance by fabricating hand drawn electrode paper sensor utilising the reverse side of the paper. This design acts as a sample storage and facilitate impedimetric sensing of ionic concentration of analyte solution using a few microlitre. Droplet formation at the bottom of the paper in the confined area is visually monitored to reduce sample wastage. The interaction between two different electrode materials (graphite and silver) on the paper substrate with the different volume and concentration of the electrolyte is analysed to improve the robustness and sensitivity of the measurement. Simultaneously, we observed a reduction in the electrical double layer effect on the low sample volumes. The proposed paper based sensor shows the enhanced impedance stability on silver electrode patterned paper chip than graphite electrode paper chip to detect the different ionic concentration of artificial sweat sample. Finally, it demonstrates that paper chip has great potential as a disposable diagnostics sensor in healthcare applications.}

  abstract  = {Air pollution is a serious threat to our health and has become one of the major causes of many diseases including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer. The association between air pollution and various diseases has long been a topic of research interest. However, it remains unclear how air pollution actually impacts health by modulating several important cellular functions. Recently, some evidence has emerged about air pollution-induced epigenetic changes, which are linked with the etiology of various human diseases. Among several epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation represents the most prominent epigenetic alteration underlying the air pollution-induced pathogenic mechanism. Several other types of epigenetic changes, such as histone modifications, miRNA, and non-coding RNA expression, have also been found to have been linked with air pollution. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), one of the most prevalent forms of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), is triggered by the inhalation of certain organic and inorganic substances. HP is characterized by inflammation in the tissues around the lungs’ airways and may lead to irreversible lung scarring over time. This review, in addition to other diseases, attempts to understand whether certain pollutants influence HP development through such epigenetic modifications.}

We aimed at assessing the tolerability and impact of long-term use of MMP inhibitor doxycycline in COPD. METHODS: A cohort of COPD patients was randomized to continue a uniform COPD treatment with or without add-on long-term oral doxycycline. The lung exacerbations (spirometry), adverse events and health status (COPD Assessment Test score) were noted at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of therapy. Measurement of the serum MMP-2, and 9 and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels was done at the start of the study and at three months, whenever possible. RESULTS: There were 27, 19, 13 and 10 patients with add-on doxycycline group and 22, 19, 11 and 7 patients with COPD treatment alone at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of treatment respectively. The improvement was obvious and mostly (at 6 and 12 months) significant (P >0.05) for lung function parameters [forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), FEV(1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC (FEF(25-75))] and universal for health status at all measurements, with an overall 26.69 per cent reduction in exacerbations. The analysis with the lung function changes in the available population with protocol violation also supported the same trend. The concomitant reduction in serum MMP-9 (P =0.01), MMP-2 (P =0.01) and hs-CRP (P =0.0001) levels (n=21) at three months was also significant. The adverse reactions with add-on doxycycline appeared acceptable. INTERPRETATION \& CONCLUSIONS: Long-term doxycycline appears well tolerated and seems to improve lung function, health status and exacerbations in COPD. The claim needs further scientific validations.}

These patients have a worse prognosis, in terms of more frequent and severe exacerbations, more frequent symptoms, worse quality of life, increased comorbidities and a faster lung function decline. In absence of clear diagnostic or therapeutic guidelines, ACO presents as a challenge to clinicians. The present study aims to investigate whether ACO patients have a distinct exhaled breath condensate (EBC) metabolic profile in comparison to asthma and COPD. A total of 132 age and BMI matched male smokers were recruited in the exploratory phase which consisted of (i) controls = 33 (ii) asthma = 34 (iii) COPD = 30 and (iv) ACO = 35. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics, 8 metabolites (fatty acid, propionate, isopropanol, lactate, acetone, valine, methanol and formate) were identified to be significantly dysregulated in ACO subjects when compared to both, asthma and COPD. The expression of these dysregulated metabolites were further validated in a fresh patient cohort consisting of (i) asthma = 32 (ii) COPD = 32 and (iii) ACO = 40, which exhibited a similar expression pattern. Multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves generated using these metabolites provided a robust ACO classification model. The findings were also integrated with previously identified serum metabolites and inflammatory markers to develop a robust predictive model for differentiation of ACO. Our findings suggest that NMR metabolomics of EBC holds potential as a platform to identify robust, non-invasive biomarkers for differentiating ACO from asthma and COPD.}

Findings over the past two decades have identified novel binding partners and cellular functions of PCSK9. Notably, PCSK9 is aberrantly expressed in a broad spectrum of cancers and apparently contributes to disease prognosis, indicating that PCSK9 could be a valuable cancer biomarker. Experimental studies demonstrate the contribution of PCSK9 in various aspects of cancer, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis, anti-tumor immunity and radioresistance, strengthening the idea that PCSK9 could be a promising therapeutic target. Here, we comprehensively review the involvement of PCSK9 in cancer, summarizing its aberrant expression, association with disease prognosis, biological functions and underlying mechanisms in various malignancies. Besides, we highlight the potential of PCSK9 as a future therapeutic target in personalized cancer medicine.}

However, the time-consuming and specificity-related complications of conventional analytical procedures necessitate the development of a method which is rapid, selective and sensitive in nature. The present work illustrates a novel; prompt; “mix and measure” cytometric-based nano-biosensing system that offers direct quantification of cell-free circulating (ccf) epigenomic signatures (methylated ccf-DNA, tri-methylated histone H3 at lysine {4, 9, 27 & 36} and argonaute 2 protein-bound ccf-micro RNAs) using triple nano-assemblies in a single tube format. Each assembly with unique structural and spectral properties comprised of n-type semiconducting nanocrystals conjugated to a specific monoclonal antibody. Our results suggested that the developed combinatorial approach may offer simultaneous detection of three distinct yet biologically interrelated signatures with high selectivity and sensitivity using flow cytometry and fluorometry in the enriched and test samples. The proposed novel nano-assembly based detection system has a considerable potential of emerging as a minimal invasive easy-to-use method that could possibly permit real-time, rapid and reproducible monitoring of epigenomic markers in clinical and field settings.}

In the present study, we investigated the mitochondrial-mediated epigenetic regulation of 2 PAHs, carcinogenic (benzo[a]pyrene; BaP) and noncarcinogenic (anthracene [ANT]), in peripheral lymphocytes. While ANT exposure triggered mitochondrial oxidative damage, no appreciable epigenetic modifications were observed. On the other hand, exposure to BaP perturbed the mitochondrial redox machinery and initiated cascade of epigenetic modifications. Cells exposed to BaP showed prominent changes in the expression of mitochondrial microRNAs (miR-24, miR-34a, miR-150, and miR-155) and their respective gene targets (NF-κβ, MYC, and p53). The exposure of BaP also caused significant alterations in the expression of epigenetic modifiers (DNMT1, HDAC1, HDAC7, KDM3a, EZH2, and P300) and hypomethylation within nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. This further induced methylation of histone tails, which play a crucial role in the regulation of chromatin structure. Overall, our study provides novel mechanistic insights into the mitochondrial regulation of epigenetic modifications in association with PAH-induced immunotoxicity.}

The presence of intrinsic growth factors was evidenced by immunoblotting of the extracted proteins derived from the placental derived extracellular matrix. This growth factor rich PIMS lends a unique bioactive scaffolding to human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (HAMSCs) which supported enhanced proliferation as well as superior osteogenic differentiation. Gene expression studies demonstrated significant up-regulation of osteogenic related genes in the PIMS group. PIMS when implanted in the chick chorioallantoic membrane, significantly attracted allantoic vessels revealing its potential to stimulate angiogenesis ex vivo. Furthermore, no severe immune response to the host was observed on subcutaneous implantation of PIMS in vivo. Instead, it supported the formation of blood vessels, revealing its outstanding biocompatibility. Additionally, critical tibial defects treated with PIMS demonstrated higher bone volume after six weeks when analyzed by micro-CT, which was accompanied by high mineral density. Histological and immunofluorescence studies validated the results and revealed enhanced osseous tissue regeneration after six weeks of surgery. All these findings recapitulated that the growth factors incorporated bioactive PIMS could perform as an appropriate matrix for osteogenic differentiation and efficient bone regeneration.}

Previously, we demonstrated the role of OS in endometriosis. Here, we performed a comprehensive investigation of several molecules involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and ECM degradation in women with endometriosis to study their interplay with OS. Methods: Blood samples were collected from women with endometriosis (N=80), as well as from women with tubal factor infertility as controls (N=80). Interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta, IL-4, −10, −2, −6, −8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, −9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, −2, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 levels in serum samples were measured using an ELISA. Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured using flow cytometry. Results: Cytokines, VEGF, MMPs, and COX-2 were significantly higher and TIMPs were significantly lower in patients with endometriosis. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that IL-10 was the most significant variable capable of discriminating endometriosis samples from controls. Conclusions: Deregulation of NF-κB activation by OS affects the expression of various cytokines in endometriosis. Elevated cytokine levels further up-regulate IL-10, which subsequently activates the MMPs, leading to excessive ECM degradation and angiogenesis. Moreover, IL-10 emerged as the most important molecule involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Measurement of these molecules may help in better management of the patients with endometriosis.},

abstract = {Purpose
Various mechanisms, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and protease-antiprotease imbalance are proposed for the progressive decline in lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Doxycycline, a broad spectrum tetracycline antibiotic, is reported to have non-antimicrobial matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) inhibitory action in various inflammatory conditions. The effect of doxycycline in COPD is hereby assessed in the present randomized prospective study.
Patients and methods
The first group of COPD patients (n = 30; mild (n = 3), moderate (n = 6), severe (n = 7), very severe (n = 14) as per GOLD II & III criteria was prescribed the standard therapy, a combination of (i) short acting anti-muscarinic agent (SAMA) + short acting β2 agonist (SABA) inhaled and (ii) corticosteroid inhaled (ICS) + long acting β2 agonist (LABA) (iii) ICS + LABA + LAMA. Whereas doxycycline (100 mg), was used daily once or twice as per Body Mass Index (BMI), as an add-on to existing standard therapy for the second group of patients (n = 30; mild (n = 2), moderate (n = 7), severe (n = 8), very severe (n = 13). All recruited patients were followed-up after 3 months of treatment. Lung function index FEV1(%) predicted, FEV1/FVC (%), quality of life status including COPD Assessment Test (CAT), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were assessed. Routine blood cell count also was performed.
Results
Biochemical analysis included estimation of oxidative stress markers, inflammatory cytokines and proteases in plasma of both the groups. Reduction in oxidative stress is evidenced by a significant decrease in Lipid hydro peroxides (LPO), total oxidative stress (TOS) and increase in glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), reduced glutathione (GSH) and total anti-oxidant capacity (TAO) nitrite and nitrate (NOx) along with peroxynitrate following 3 months of add-on doxycycline treatment. Reduced levels of cytokines such as interleukin IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8 were also observed. Multivariate analysis identified TNF-α major effective discriminant among pre and post doxycycline treated COPD patients. The expression of TNF-α was inversely correlated with FEV1/FVC (%) changes. The levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9/tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 ratio (MMP-9/ TIMP-1), also decreased significantly and the decline could be associated with TOS. A significant increase in bilirubin and reduced glutathione (GSH) level was noticed in standard therapy group.
Conclusion
These data suggest that the improvement in lung function and quality of life in COPD patients may probably be attributed to the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-MMP activity of doxycycline. The potential therapeutic role of long-term doxycycline, in addition to its traditional antibiotic effect, definitely warrants further attention.}

The high-risk group reported marked changes in the expression levels of epigenetic modifiers (DNMT1, DNMT3a, EZH2, EHMT2 and HAT), that maintains the levels of specific epigenetic marks essential for appropriate gene functioning. These results also coincided with the observed alterations in the levels of DNA methylation (LINE-1 and % 5mC), and histone modifications (H3 and H4), among the high-risk group. In addition, higher degree of changes reported in the expression profile of a selected miRNA panel in the high-risk group indicated the probability of deregulated transcriptional machinery. This was further confirmed by the analysis of a target gene panel involved in various signalling pathways, which revealed differential expression of the gene transcripts regulating cell cycle, inflammation, cell survival, apoptosis and cell adhesion. Together, our results provide first insights of epigenetic modifications among individuals living in different high and low levels of air pollution zones of India. However, further steps to develop a point-of-care epigenomic assay for human bio-monitoring may be immensely beneficial to reduce the health burden of air pollution especially in low and-middle-income countries.}

Cancer Stem Cells are envisaged as a critical underlying factor for therapy resistance. Thus, there is a critical need for developing approaches to diminish the enrichment of cancer stem cells and acquirement of resistance. Administration of metformin, a commonly prescribed drug against Type II diabetes exhibited promising effect in the management of ovarian cancer. However, the effect of long term administration of low dose of metformin as an adjuvant to cisplatin and paclitaxel during acquirement of chemoresistant phenotype has not been investigated so far. Using two isogenic cellular chemoresistant models (A2780 and OAW42) developed in the presence or absence of metformin, we demonstrated the ability of metformin to impede the development of resistance through increased drug sensitivity, increased proliferation, and reduced migratory abilities of the resistant cells. Metformin introduction also decreased the cancer stem cell population, expression of specific biomarkers and pluripotent genes. Further metabolic profiling of these cells using 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy revealed significant modulation in taurine and histidine levels in resistant cells developed in the presence of metformin. Intriguingly, taurine treatment considerably reduced the cancer stem cell population and chemoresistance in resistant cells, indicating a novel role of taurine in differentiation of ovarian cancer stem cells. Altogether this is the first report on the potential role of metformin for targeting the cancer stem cell population via up regulation of taurine, leading to impediment in the acquirement of chemoresistance.}

abstract = {Air pollution is one of the leading causes of deaths in Southeast Asian countries including India. Exposure to air pollutants affects vital cellular mechanisms and is intimately linked with the etiology of a number of chronic diseases. Earlier work from our laboratory has shown that airborne particulate matter disturbs the mitochondrial machinery and causes significant damage to the epigenome. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species possess the ability to trigger redox-sensitive signaling mechanisms and induce irreversible epigenomic changes. The electrophilic nature of reactive metabolites can directly result in deprotonation of cytosine at C-5 position or interfere with the DNA methyltransferases activity to cause alterations in DNA methylation. In addition, it also perturbs level of cellular metabolites critically involved in different epigenetic processes like acetylation and methylation of histone code and DNA hypo or hypermethylation. Interestingly, these modifications may persist through downstream generations and result in the transgenerational epigenomic inheritance. This phenomenon of subsequent transfer of epigenetic modifications is mainly associated with the germ cells and relies on the germline stability of the epigenetic states. Overall, the recent literature supports, and arguably strengthens, the contention that air pollution might contribute to transmission of epimutations from gametes to zygotes by involving mitochondrial DNA, parental allele imprinting, histone withholding and non-coding RNAs. However, larger prospective studies using innovative, integrated epigenome-wide metabolomic strategy are highly warranted to assess the air pollution induced transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and associated human health effects.}

This finding motivated us to identify the contributory bioactive metabolite(s) responsible for inhibition AChE using Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry based metabolomics and chemometric approach. The metabolite levels as well as AChE inhibitory activity varied in different flower samples collected from different districts of West Bengal in the monsoon season. Different multivariate analyses differentiated the extracts with low activity (< 45\% inhibition) from that of higher activities (> 45\% inhibition). Chemometric analysis revealed gallic acid, a previously reported metabolite, to be one of the contributors significantly related to the inhibition of AChE by the flower extracts. Kaempferol, although negatively correlated, inhibited AChE. A probable synergistic action of metabolites is suggested for the AChE inhibitory property of N. pubescens flower extracts. Practical applications Nymphaea pubescens flower is edible in different countries. The flowers also have different medicinal properties. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. As the flower extracts of this plant inhibited acetylcholinesterase, although the activity of the flower extracts varied with locality of collection. The level of metabolites also varied. A detailed study was made to identify the active constituents. Gallic acid and kaempferol were found to have high acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. The study suggested that consumption of this edible part of the plant may have beneficiary effect on memory function.},

The surface chemistry of the grafted LDPE was characterized using different characterization tools. The effect of MA grafting for analysis of bulk properties such as the change in mechanical strength and thermal properties was studied. Further, the nanoindentation study was performed to analyze the surface mechanical property after MA grafting. Biocompatibility studies were carried out using NIH-3T3 cells through MTT assay test. FTIR analysis revealed the presence of carboxylic groups on LDPE surface. The contact angle value was found to be 44 ± 3°, which confirms the development of hydrophilicity in LDPE. Cell viability was found >75\% in MTT assay.

  abstract  = {Particulate matter directly emitted into the air by sources such as combustion processes and windblown dust, or formed in the atmosphere by transformation of emitted gases are the major contributors to air pollution that triggers a diverse array of human pathologies including lung cancer. The mortality in lung cancer is usually high as the disease is not symptomatic at its early treatable stage. Moreover, available methods for screening are costly and mainly rely on imaging techniques which lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Despite progress in the identification of biomarkers, gene mutation based approaches still face formidable challenges as the disease evolves from a complex interplay between environment and host. Therefore, identification of an epigenomic signature might be useful for early diagnosis with the potential to reduce the environmental-associated disease burden. The review discusses the utility of epigenomic signature in identification and management of the environmental-associated lung cancers. Non-invasive 'liquid biopsy' based epigenomic screening has recently emerged as a methodology which has potential to characterize tumor heterogeneity at initial stages. Epigenetic signatures (methylated DNA, miRNA, and post transcriptionally modified histones) known to reflect the vital cellular changes, circulate at higher levels in the individuals with lung cancer. These circulating biological entities are reported to be closely associated with the clinical outcome of lung cancer patients and thus strongly stand as the probable candidate to identify disease at an early stage and monitor treatment response, thereby, benefiting patients and improving their lives. However, for effective implementation of the strategy as "point-of-care" test for screening population-at-risk will require exhaustive clinical validation.},

  abstract  = {Lung cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related death for men in our country. The only recommended screening method is clinic based low-dose computed tomography (also called a low-dose CT scan, or LDCT). However, the effect of LDCT on overall mortality observed in lung cancer patients is not statistically significant. Over-diagnosis, excessive cost, risks associated with radiation exposure, false positive results and delay in the commencement of the treatment procedure questions the use of LDCT as a reliable technique for population-based screening. Therefore, identification of minimal-invasive biomarkers able to detect malignancies at an early stage might be useful to reduce the disease burden. Circulating nucleic acids are emerging as important source of information for several chronic pathologies including lung cancer. Of these, circulating cell free miRNAs are reported to be closely associated with the clinical outcome of lung cancer patients. Smaller size, sequence homology between species, low concentration and stability are some of the major challenges involved in characterization and specific detection of miRNAs. To circumvent these problems, synthesis of a quantum dot based nano-biosensor might assist in sensitive, specific and cost-effective detection of differentially regulated miRNAs. The wide excitation and narrow emission spectra of these nanoparticles result in excellent fluorescent quantum yields with a broader color spectrum which make them ideal bio-entities for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based detection for sequential or simultaneous study of multiple targets. In addition, photo-resistance and higher stability of these nanoparticles allows extensive exposure and offer state-of-the art sensitivity for miRNA targeting. A major obstacle for integrating QDs into clinical application is the QD-associated toxicity. However, the use of non-toxic shells along with surface modification not only overcomes the toxicity issues, but also increases the ability of QDs to quickly detect circulating cell free miRNAs in a non-invasive mode. The present review illustrates the importance of circulating miRNAs in lung cancer diagnosis and highlights the translational prospects of developing QD-based nano-biosensor for rapid early disease detection.},

Analysis was performed on spectral data and on relative concentrations of metabolites obtained from spectra using multivariate and univariate data analysis. Analysis shows that various energy, ketogenic and glucogenic metabolites have significant altered concentrations in various stages of endometriosis. In addition, altered tissue metabolites in minimal and mild stages of endometriosis were explored in serum of these patients to assess their role in disease diagnosis. For Stage I diagnosis alanine was found to have 90\% sensitivity (true positives) and 58\% specificity (true negatives). For Stage II diagnosis alanine, leucine, lysine, proline and phenylalanine showed significant altered levels in serum. While sensitivity of these serum metabolites varied between 69.2–100\% the specificity values ranged between 58.3–91.7\%. Further, a regression model generated with this panel of serum markers showed an improved sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and 83\%, respectively for Stage II diagnosis.}

Recent studies have linked PM exposure (coarse and fine particles) with several human diseases including cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ultrafine PM exposure induced cellular and sub-cellular repercussions are ill-defined. Since mitochondria are one of the major targets of different environmental pollutants, we herein aimed to understand the molecular repercussion of ultrafine PM exposure on mitochondrial machinery in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Upon comparative analysis, a significantly higher DCF fluorescence was observed in ultrafine PM exposed cells that confirmed the strong pro-oxidant nature of these particles. In addition, the depleted activity of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase suggested the strong association of ultrafine PM with oxidative stress. These results further coincided with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, altered mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity and decline in mtDNA copy number. Moreover, the higher accumulation of DNA damage response proteins (γH2AX, pATM, p-p53), suggested that exposure to ultrafine PM induces DNA damage and triggers phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase mediated response pathway. Further, the alterations in mitochondrial machinery and redox balance among ultrafine PM exposed cells were accompanied by a considerably elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Interestingly, the lower apoptosis levels observed in ultrafine particle treated cells suggest the possibility that the marked alterations may lead to the impairment of mitochondrial-nuclear cross talk. Together, our results showed that ultrafine PM, because of their smaller size possesses significant ability to disturb mitochondrial redox homeostasis and activates phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase mediated DNA damage response pathway, an unknown molecular paradigm of ultrafine PM exposure. Our findings also indicate that maneuvering through the mitochondrial function might be a viable, indirect method to modulate lymphocyte homeostasis in air pollution associated immune disorders.}

Combination of univariate and multivariate statistical treatment identified significant alterations of 42 and 32 metabolites in tissue and serum samples of IDC, respectively when compared to control. Some of the metabolite changes from tissue were also reflected in serum, indicating a bi-directional interaction of metabolites in IDC. Additionally, 8 tissue metabolites and 9 serum metabolites showed progressive change from control to benign to IDC suggesting their possible role in malignant transformation. We have identified a panel of three metabolites viz. tryptophan, tyrosine, and creatine in tissue and serum, which could be useful in screening of IDC subjects from both control and benign. The metabolomic alterations in IDC showed perturbations in purine and pyrimidine metabolism, amino sugar metabolism, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis etc. Comprehensively, this study provides valuable insights into metabolic adaptations of IDC, which can help to identify diagnostic markers as well as potential therapeutic targets.},

  abstract  = {Successful implantation is dependent on the appropriate decidualization of endometrial stromal cells for the establishment of pregnancy in women. Mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (HSP65) is involved in pathogenesis of the genital tuberculosis (GTB), one of the common causes of infertility in emerging countries. Though implantation failure appears to be the major cause, understanding the status of decidualizaiton process in women diagnosed with GTB has not been thoroughly addressed. We, therefore, explored the effect of HSP65 protein on the endometrial cell metabolism during in vitro decidualization. In order to identify the cellular metabolism of decidual cells with and without HSP65 treatment, proton NMR based characterization of metabolites extracted from cells and culture media were performed. In presence of HSP65, significant reduction in the decidual phenotype of endometrial stromal cells and prolactin expression is suggestive of impairment in decidualization. The intracellular and extracellular metabolic changes in HSP65 treated endometrial stromal cells produced a distinct pattern, reflecting the interaction between the protein and cellular metabolism. HSP65 mediated dysregulation in cellular metabolism is associated with poor decidualization. Besides enriching the present knowledge on metabolic changes underlying stromal cells decidualization, these findings assist in identifying potential molecular causes for decidualization failure in GTB women.}

abstract  ="Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most commonly occurring metabolic and endocrinological disorders affecting women of reproductive age. Metabolomics is an emerging field that holds promise in understanding disease pathophysiology. Recently{,} a few metabolomics based studies have been attempted in PCOS patients; however{,} none of them have included patients from the Indian population. The main objective of this study was to investigate the serum metabolomic profile of Indian women with PCOS and compare them with controls. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) was used to first identify the differentially expressed metabolites among women with PCOS from the Eastern region of India during the discovery phase and further validated in a separate cohort of PCOS and control subjects. Multivariate analysis of the binned spectra indicated 16 dysregulated bins in the sera of these women with PCOS. Out of these 16 bins{,} 13 identified bins corresponded to 12 metabolites including 8 amino acids and 4 energy metabolites. Amongst the amino acids{,} alanine{,} valine{,} leucine and threonine and amongst the energy metabolites{,} lactate and acetate were observed to be significantly up-regulated in women with PCOS when compared with controls. The remaining 4 amino acids{,} l-glutamine{,} proline{,} glutamate and histidine were down-regulated along with 2 energy metabolites: glucose and 3-hydroxybutyric acid. Our findings showed dysregulations in the expression of different metabolites in the serum of women with PCOS suggesting the involvement of multiple pathways including amino acid metabolism{,} carbohydrate/lipid metabolism{,} purine and pyrimidine metabolism and protein synthesis."}

abstract = {Being molecularly heterogeneous, breast cancer tends to be a complicated oncological disease with high incidence rates throughout the world. The primary aim of this study was to identify the set of serum proteins with discriminatory capabilities towards the four major subtypes of breast cancer. We employed multipronged quantitative proteomic approaches like 2D-DIGE, iTRAQ and SWATH-MS and identified 307 differentially regulated proteins. Luminal A subtype consisted of 24, Luminal B subtype 38, HER2 Enriched subtype 17 and Triple negative breast cancer subtype 10 differentially regulated subtype specific proteins. These specific proteins were further subjected to bioinformatic tools which revealed the involvement in platelet degranulation, fibrinolysis, lipid metabolism, immune response, complement activation, blood coagulation, glycolysis and cancer signaling pathways in the subtypes of the breast cancer. The significant discrimination efficiency of the models generated through multivariate statistical analysis was decent to distinguish each of the four subtypes from controls. Further, some of the statistically significant differentially regulated proteins were verified and validated by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry based selected reaction monitoring (SRM) approach. Our Multipronged proteomics approaches revealed panel of serum proteins specifically altered for individual subtypes of breast cancer. The mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD006441.
Biological significance
Worldwide, breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths in women and it encompasses four major molecular subtypes. As breast cancer treatment majorly depends on identification of specific subtype, it is important to diagnosis the disease at subtype level. Our results using multipronged quantitative proteomics identified 307 differentially regulated proteins in which 24 were specific for Luminal A, 38 for Luminal B, 17 for HER2 enriched and 10 proteins were specific for TN subtype. Bioinformatic analysis of these proteins revealed certain biological processes and pathways altered at subtype level and validation experiments of some of these proteins using immunoblotting and SRM assays are consistent with discovery data. This is the first comprehensive proteomic study on serum proteome alterations at subtype level which will not only help to distinguish subtype of breast cancer but also contribute to a better understanding of the molecular characteristic of breast cancer at individual subtype level.}

The acquired data were analyzed using multivariate principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal projection to latent structure with discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). A clear metabolic differentiation was apparent between the pre and post doxycycline treated group. The distinguishing metabolites lactate and fatty acids were significantly down-regulated and formate, citrate, imidazole and l-arginine upregulated. Lactate and folate are further validated biochemically. Metabolic changes, such as decreased lactate level, inhibited arginase activity and lowered fatty acid level observed in COPD patients in response to add-on doxycycline treatment, reflect the anti-inflammatory action of the drug. Doxycycline as a possible therapeutic option for COPD seems promising.}

 Abstract = {Background: Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is the substance responsible
of the irritation caused by the contact of chili peppers with the skin or mucous membranes. This protoalkaloid
acts by stimulating the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1
(TRPV1), which is mainly expressed by nociceptive fibers of peripheral sensory neurons, but is also
present in the central nervous system, and in some non-neuronal cells. Following the initial, intense
neuronal excitation, a brief refractory period occurs. However, repeated and massive exposures to capsaicin
can impair nociceptive fiber function for weeks or months. During this lapse of time, disorders
related to the hyperreactivity of peripheral nociceptors are abolished or greatly reduced. Capsaicin has
been utilized to treat several diseases of upper airways.

Objective: The objective of this review was to report the latest findings on the use of Capsaicin in the
treatment of upper airway diseases.

Results: Capsaicin effectiveness has been proved in non allergic rhinitis. Some studies suggest that
this substance may be also effective in nasal polyposis and in the burning mouth syndrome. No clear
evidence has been obtained about its use in allergic rhinitis.

Conclusion: To date, the use of capsaicin to treat upper airway diseases is still limited in clinical practice.
This may originate by the lack of strong, conclusive evidences of its effectiveness, by the variety
of therapeutic schemes used in literature, and finally by the unpleasant effects of the exposure to capsaicin,
which are only partly relieved by the pretreatment with local anesthetics.}

Partial least squares discriminant analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis models showed good classification among the two groups, diffusion and infusion, based on metabolites. Both infusion and decoction inhibited the enzyme. However, the activity differed with samples. Multivariate analysis also segregated extracts on the basis of activity.

Majority of these chronic ailments are curable, if diagnosed at early stages. Candidate biomarkers of early detection are therefore essential for identification of high-risk individuals, prompt and accurate disease diagnosis, and to monitor therapeutic response. The functional significance of circulating nucleic acids that recapitulate specific disease profiles is now well established. But subtle changes in DNA sequence may not solely reflect the differentiation of gene expression patterns observed in diverse set of diseases as epigenetic phenomena play a larger role in aetiology and patho-physiology. Unlike genetic markers, knowledge about the diagnostic utility of circulating epigenetic signatures: methylated DNA; micro RNA and modified histones are deficient. Characterization of these novel entities through omics-based molecular technologies might prompt development of a range of laboratory-based strategies, thereby accelerating their broader translational purpose for early disease diagnosis, monitoring therapeutic response and drug resistance. However, largest opportunity for innovation lies in developing point-of-care tests with accurate diagnostic and higher prognostic score that is applicable for screening of high-risk populations.}

Although biomarker discoveries through various proteomic approaches of tissue and serum samples have been studied in breast cancer, urinary proteome alterations in breast cancer are least studied. Urine being a noninvasive biofluid and a significant source of proteins, it has the potential in early diagnosis of breast cancer. This study used complementary quantitative gel-based and gel-free proteomic approaches to find a panel of urinary protein markers that could discriminate HER2 enriched (HE) subtype breast cancer from the healthy controls. A total of 183 differentially expressed proteins were identified using three complementary approaches, namely 2D-DIGE, iTRAQ, and sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra. The differentially expressed proteins were subjected to various bioinformatics analyses for deciphering the biological context of these proteins using protein analysis through evolutionary relationships, database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery, and STRING. Multivariate statistical analysis was undertaken to identify the set of most significant proteins, which could discriminate HE breast cancer from healthy controls. Immunoblotting and MRM-based validation in a separate cohort testified a panel of 21 proteins such as zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein, A2GL, retinol-binding protein 4, annexin A1, SAP3, SRC8, gelsolin, kininogen 1, CO9, clusterin, ceruloplasmin, and α1-antitrypsin could be a panel of candidate markers that could discriminate HE breast cancer from healthy controls.},

    abstract = {Is there any difference at the serum metabolic level between women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and women with recurrent implantation success (RIS) when undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)?Eight metabolites, including valine, adipic acid, l-lysine, creatine, ornithine, glycerol, d-glucose and urea, were found to be significantly up-regulated in women with RIF when compared with women with RIS.Despite transfer of three high-grade embryos per cycle, RIF following three or more consecutive IVF attempts occurs in a group of infertile women. Conversely, there is a group of women who undergo successful implantation each cycle, yet have a poor obstetric history.This study was conducted over a period of 10 years (January 2004–October 2014). Groups of 28 women with RIF (age ≤40 years and BMI ≤28) and 24 women with RIS (age and BMI matched) were selected from couples with primary infertility reporting at the Institute of Reproductive Medicine, Kolkata, India. Women recruited in the RIF group had history of implantation failure in at least three consecutive IVF attempts, in which three embryos of high-grade quality were transferred in each cycle.Blood samples were collected from both the groups during the implantation window following overnight fasting for at least 10 h (7–10 days post ovulation). Samples were analyzed using a 700 MHz NMR spectrometer and acquired spectra were subjected to chemometric and statistical analysis. Serum levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were measured using an enzyme immunoassay technique.Valine, adipic acid, l-lysine, creatine, ornithine, glycerol, d-glucose and urea were found to be significantly down-regulated in women with RIS when compared with those with RIF, with fold change values of 0.81, 0.82, 0.79, 0.80, 0.78, 0.68, 0.76 and 0.74, respectively. Further, serum eNOS was found to be significantly lower in women with RIF when compared with RIS (P \&lt; 0.05), indicating possible impairment in nitric oxide production. Metabolites, mostly related to energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and the arginine metabolic pathway were found to be considerably altered and are likely to be associated with the RIF phenomenon. However, the interplay between these molecules in RIF is complex and holds merit for further exploration.In-depth studies of the arginine metabolic pathway in endometrial tissues seem necessary to validate our findings. A limitation of the present study is that the metabolic level changes, eNOS and nitric oxide levels have not been investigated in the endometrial tissues of the two groups of women. It would be interesting to investigate whether there exists a direct link between metabolic dysregulation and genetic factors that affects implantation in RIF women.We speculate that tissue metabolomics can provide an improved understanding of the metabolic dysfunction associated with RIF. The identification of serum metabolic marker(s) in women with RIS may help with strategies of early therapeutic intervention, which may improve the chances of implantation significantly in women otherwise susceptible to IVF failure.One of the authors, S.R.C. acknowledges the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Government of India [No: 9/81(1228)/14, EMR-I] for financial support.},

The nanoparticles were prepared by a desolvation method and characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The particles were smooth and spherical in nature with an average size of 220±8nm. The encapsulation efficiency was found to be 84%. The in vitro release profile showed a biphasic pattern and the release rate increases with increase in ionic strength of solution. We have also confirmed the antioxidant activity of the prepared nanoparticles by a DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay. Further its anticancer activity was evaluated using MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Our findings suggest that fisetin loaded HSA nanoparticles could be used to transfer fisetin to target areas under specific conditions and thus may find use as a delivery vehicle for the flavonoid.}

It was observed from the chemometric analysis that gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, benzene-1,2,4-triol, and D-malic acid are responsible for high $\alpha$-amylase inhibitory activity. Gallic acid and chlorogenic acid are positively correlated with high $\alpha$-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Inhibition of the two enzymes by gallic acid, benzene-1,2,4-triol, chlorogenic acid, and $\alpha$-amylase by D-malic acid supported the findings. The present experiment reports the importance of both primary and secondary metabolites for the bioactivity of plant extracts.}

Expression of endometrial receptivity markers and LIF-STAT3 signaling in in vitro decidualized human endometrial stromal cells (hESC) treated with 65 kDa mycobacterial heat shock protein (HSP65) is also explored. 
  Design: A prospective study. 
  Setting: Tertiary care hospital and reproductive health research unit. 
  Patient(s): Endometrial tissue samples were collected from 38 women who tested positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 30 normal women with proven fertility undergoing sterilization. In vitro decidualization of hESC was performed. 
  Intervention(s): Endometrial biopsies collected from all women during implantation window and treatment of hESC with HSP65. 
  Main Outcome Measure(s): Measurement of various endometrial receptivity markers including αvβ3 integrin, E-cadherin, MECA-79, mucin-1, and pinopodes and LIF/LIFR-STAT3 signaling molecules expressed in the endometrium of women with dormant genital tuberculosis (GTB) during implantation window and measured also in HSP65-treated hESC. 
  Result(s): Significantly reduced levels of endometrial receptivity markers LIF, LIFR, and pSTAT3 were observed in endometrium of women with dormant GTB as compared with controls. A similar trend was observed under in vitro conditions with decreased level of phosphorylated STAT3 in HSP65-treated hESC. However, no change in the expression of endometrial receptivity markers under in vitro conditions was observed. 
  Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that endometrium of women with dormant GTB is associated with poor receptivity, as evidenced by reduced receptivity markers and aberrant LIF-STAT3 signaling. In vitro treatment of hESC with HSP65 also confirms compromised endometrial decidualization.}

    abstract = {Does investigation of metabolic perturbations in endometrial tissue of women with dormant genital tuberculosis (GTB) during the window of implantation (WOI) assist in improving the understanding of endometrial receptivity?In dormant GTB cases significant alterations in endometrial tissue metabolites occur, largely related to energy metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis in dormant GTB cases.As an intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis strongly influences the metabolism of host cells causing metabolic dysregulation. It is also accepted that dormant GTB impairs the receptive status of the endometrium. Global metabolic profiling is useful for an understanding of disease progression and distinguishing between diseased and non-diseased groups.Endometrial tissue samples were collected from patients reporting at the tertiary infertility care center during the period September 2011–March 2013. Women having tested positive for GTB were considered as the study group (n = 24). Normal healthy women undergoing sterilization (n = 26) and unexplained infertile women with repeated IVF failure (n = 21) volunteered to participate as controls.Endometrial tissue samples were collected 6–10 days after confirmation of ovulation. PCR and BACTEC-460 culture were used for diagnosing GTB. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra of tissue were recorded using a 700 MHz Bruker Avance AV III spectrometer. Following phase and baseline correction of all NMR spectra by Bruker Topspin 2.1 software, spectral peak alignment of the data was performed. Multivariate analysis was applied to all spectra and individual metabolites identified and multiple correlation analysis was performed.Leucine, isoleucine, acetate, lactate, glutamate, glutamine, methionine, lysine, creatine, glycogen, glycine, proline and choline were found to be significantly increased (P \&lt; 0.05) in endometrial tissue of women with dormant GTB compared with unexplained infertile women with repeated implantation failure. Valine, citrate, succinate and aspartate were also observed to be significantly up-regulated (P \&lt; 0.01). Furthermore, a significant decrease in glucose (P \&lt; 0.05), threonine (P \&lt; 0.05), tyrosine (P \&lt; 0.01) and phenylalanine (P \&lt; 0.0001) was observed in women with dormant GTB. Pearson's correlation analysis between the expression of various endometrial receptivity markers and metabolites showed a significant negative correlation (−0.236 to −0.545, P \&lt; 0.05). Also, the metabolites were positively correlated with endometrial receptivity markers (0.207 to 0.618, P \&lt; 0.05).It is often difficult to diagnose dormant GTB because it tends to exist without any clinical signs or symptoms. In addition, the diagnosis of GTB by culture remains a challenge due to low detection rates and its paucibacillary nature. Testing for prostate-specific antigen or the Y chromosome in order to account for the possible influences of recent exposure to semen on endometrial metabolism would be important.The metabolic changes associated with the dormant tubercle infection are of potential relevance to clinicians for the treatment of dormant GTB-related infertility.Government of India, Indian Council of Medical Research.

Although biomarker discoveries through various proteomic approaches have been studied in breast cancer, a limited number of studies have explored the invasive ductal carcinoma with Luminal B HER2 positive (LB) and HER2 enriched (HE) subtypes. The present study employed the complementary quantitative proteomic approaches to find a panel of markers that could discriminate LB and HE subtypes as well as early (ES) and late stages (LS) of these subtypes. A total of 67 and 68 differentially expressed proteins were identified by DIGE for the subtype and stage wise categories, respectively. Multivariate statistical analysis was employed to identify the set of most significant proteins, which could discriminate between these two subtypes and also early and late stages under study. Immunoblotting and MRM based validation in a separate cohort of samples confirmed that panel of biosignatures for LB are APOA1, GELS, HS90B, EF1A1, NHRF1 and PRDX3 and for HE are PRDX1, CATD, CALR, ATPB and CH60. For the diagnosis of early and late stages the potential markers are TPM4, CATD, PRDX3, ANXA3, HSPB1 and CALR, TRFE, GELS, CH60, CAPG, NHRF1, 1433G, GRP78 respectively.}

In the present study an attempt has been made to overcome these drawbacks by encapsulating morin and epicatechin separately into a suitable nanocarrier. We have prepared morin loaded human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles (Mor-HSA-NPs) and epicatechin loaded HSA nanoparticles (EC-HSA-NPs) using a desolvation technique{,} which have been further characterised for particle size{,} morphology{,} morin/epicatechin content in nanoparticles{,} and their in vitro release. The particle size of the prepared formulation was ∼170 ± 6 nm for Mor-HSA-NPs and ∼200 ± 12 nm for EC-HSA-NPs with an almost spherical shape and smooth surface. The release profile exhibited an initial burst release followed by a sustained release. The cytotoxicity of Mor-HSA-NPs and EC-HSA-NPs against the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line has been investigated by MTT assay and the results show that the nanoparticles are capable of destroying the cancer cells more potently than morin/epicatechin alone. This is also supported by fluorescence microscopy images. This result is likely to facilitate an understanding of how to enhance the delivery of flavonoids like morin and epicatechin by encapsulation."}

Metabolomics is an emerging field that holds promise in understanding disease pathophysiology. Recently{,} a few metabolomics based studies have been attempted in PCOS patients; however{,} none of them have included patients from the Indian population. The main objective of this study was to investigate the serum metabolomic profile of Indian women with PCOS and compare them with controls. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) was used to first identify the differentially expressed metabolites among women with PCOS from the Eastern region of India during the discovery phase and further validated in a separate cohort of PCOS and control subjects. Multivariate analysis of the binned spectra indicated 16 dysregulated bins in the sera of these women with PCOS. Out of these 16 bins{,} 13 identified bins corresponded to 12 metabolites including 8 amino acids and 4 energy metabolites. Amongst the amino acids{,} alanine{,} valine{,} leucine and threonine and amongst the energy metabolites{,} lactate and acetate were observed to be significantly up-regulated in women with PCOS when compared with controls. The remaining 4 amino acids{,} l-glutamine{,} proline{,} glutamate and histidine were down-regulated along with 2 energy metabolites: glucose and 3-hydroxybutyric acid. Our findings showed dysregulations in the expression of different metabolites in the serum of women with PCOS suggesting the involvement of multiple pathways including amino acid metabolism{,} carbohydrate/lipid metabolism{,} purine and pyrimidine metabolism and protein synthesis."}

Osteochondral tissue engineering is an important clinical aspect of the management and treatment of cartilage and underlying bone. In the present study{,} we fabricated human placenta-derived extracellular matrix sponges (PEMS) for repair of osteochondral tissue through a decellularization process. There were no significant cellular components present in the PEMS; hematoxylin & eosin/DAPI staining{,} DNA quantification and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to evaluate the extent of decellularization. Moreover{,} no significant alteration to the collagen and glycosaminoglycan (native extracellular matrix) content of the PEMS was observed. PEMS in vitro provided a non-cytotoxic environment rich in bioactive cues for human amniotic membrane-derived stem cells (HAMSCs) to proliferate in and differentiate into chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages under induction. Histological analysis at 28 days after the PEMS were subcutaneously implanted demonstrated no severe immune response in the host and supported the formation of blood vessels. To assess the osteochondral tissue repair ability of PEMS{,} cell-free PEMS (CFP) and cell-seeded PEMS (CSP) were implanted at osteochondral defect sites in a rabbit model. Histological scores indicated that osteochondral regeneration was more successful in the defects filled with CSP compared to those filled with CFP and empty defects (ED) after 60 days of implantation. In summary{,} a naturally derived biocompatible scaffold composed of extracellular matrix from human placenta has been successfully developed for osteochondral tissue engineering."}

NPs of different drug-polymer ratio formulations (F1, F2, F3, F4) were fabricated using solvent evaporation technique. Physico-chemical characteristics of these NPs were assessed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) spectrophotometer. In-vitro drug release study was carried out over an extended period of 30 days at 37 °C in simulated physiological fluid. To evaluate the release kinetics, data was fitted to different models. NPs with various sizes and size distributions were obtained by altering the drug-polymer ratio. Zeta potential of PLGA and drug loaded NPs were found to be-29.4± 1.3 mV and-21.0±0.6 mV, respectively. The release kinetics of the drug from NPs was in good agreement with Korsmeyer-Peppas model, ensuring controlled release of the drug from the NPs. In-vitro release studies showed high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.90) for formulation F2 and F3 up to 30 days. It is concluded that NPs with F2 and F3 formulations provide a controlled release of the incorporated drug and, therefore, hold promise to be investigated further in detail.}

GDM is considered a high-risk state which may lead to type II diabetes which is associated with an increase in a number of interrelated adverse perinatal outcomes. Given the fact that the progress of a successful pregnancy is dependent on the intricate communication between several biological molecules, identification of the proteomic profile perturbations in women with GDM is expected to help in understanding the disease pathogenesis and also discovery of clinical biomarker(s). In recent years, both gel-free and gel-based proteomics have been extensively investigated for improving maternal and child health. Although there are several reports integrating various aspects of proteomics in pregnancy related diseases such as preeclampsia, extensive Pubmed search shows no review so far on the application of proteomics in gestational diabetes. In this review, we focus on various high-throughput proteomic technologies for the identification of unique biosignatures and biomarkers responsible for the early prediction of GDM. Further, different analytical strategies and biological samples involved in proteomic analysis of this pregnancy-related disease are discussed.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics in India.}

The present study involves investigation of alterations in the serum proteome of endometriosis patients compared to healthy controls using 2DE and 2D-DIGE combined with MALDI TOF/TOF-MS. Comparison of serum proteome of endometriosis patients and healthy subjects revealed 25 significant differentially expressed proteins. Gene ontology and network analysis, performed using PANTHER, DAVID, WebGestalt and STRING, revealed that the differentially expressed proteins are majorly involved in response to stimulus, immune system, metabolic, localization and cellular processes. For serum diagnostic marker identification, several robust statistical screening procedures were applied to identify the set of the most significant proteins responsible for successful diagnosis of different endometriosis stages. Partial least squares (PLS) based marker selection tool and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to identify the most significant proteins for disease prediction. Western blotting validation in a separate cohort of patients revealed that haptoglobin (HP), Ig kappa chain C region (IGKC), alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG) can be considered effective serum protein markers for the diagnosis of Stage II, III and IV endometriosis. For diagnosis of Stage I, only IGKC and HP seemed promising.
Biological significance
Globally, about 12 in 100 women of reproductive age are diagnosed with endometriosis. The pathogenesis of the disease still remains unclear, leading to non-specific therapeutic approaches for disease management. Moreover, there is a delay of 8–12years in correct diagnosis after the initial onset of symptoms leading to a considerable impact on the woman's lifestyle. Also, the gold standard for diagnosis of endometriosis, laparoscopy, is an invasive procedure. The value of a noninvasive or semi-invasive diagnostic test for endometriosis with easily accessible fluids such as plasma, serum, urine, and saliva is, therefore, rightfully recognized. The present study is expected to considerably improve the understanding of the disease pathogenesis along with improved diagnostics and therapeutic approaches leading to better management of the disease.}

Pregnant women without history of recurrent miscarriage served as controls (group C, n = 32). The outcome measures consisted of endometrial blood flow parameters by Doppler indices and ongoing pregnancy rate. Results Before progesterone supplementation, resistivity index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were found to be significantly higher in groups A and B as compared to controls. Although statistically not significant, end diastolic velocity (EDV) and systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio was found to be superior in controls than IRSM women. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) was comparable between IRSM and non-IRSM groups. Following progesterone supplementation, groups A and B showed a highly significant reduction in RI, PI and an increase in EDV. A relative increase in the value of PSV was observed in group A as compared to group B. There was remarkable difference in S/D in both groups. Although not statistically significant, group C showed reduction in RI, PI, PSV, EDV and S/D ratio. Pregnancy salvage rates were higher in group A (92.0\%) as compared to group B (82.3\%). Conclusion Progesterone supplementation appears to lower vascular resistance in women with IRSM. Oral dydrogesterone appears to be equally effective in improving endometrial blood flow as compared with micronized progesterone.},

  abstract  = {Nanotherapeutics is emerging as a promising option to the various limitations and side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy. The present study investigates the cytotoxic effect of redox-active cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria) on human colorectal adenocarcinoma-derived cell line (HCT 15). Exposure of these cells to nanoceria for 24 h with concentration ranging between 10 and 100 μM resulted in a significant reduction of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Further, at a concentration of 10 µM, nanoceria exhibited time-dependent cytotoxic effect when exposed to the cells for 24, 48, and 72 h. Upon treatment of the cells with nanoceria, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation which are indicators of oxidative stress and cytotoxicity increased significantly, in a dose-dependent manner. Nanoceria was also found to depolarize the mitochondrial membrane, thereby collapsing the membrane potential and leading to initiation of apoptosis. Scanning electron microscopic study of nanoceria-treated HCT 15 cells showed morphological changes and loss of filopodia and lamellipodia, indicating arrest of metastatic spread. Summarizing, when cultured HCT 15 cells are exposed to nanoceria, a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect mediated by ROS generation is observed.}

abstract = {The present work focuses on the design of a drug delivery system for systemic, controlled release of the poorly soluble breast cancer drug, letrozole. The drug delivery system was prepared in two steps: a low density polyethylene (LDPE) substrate surface was grafted with maleic anhydride (MA) via solution grafting technique. Next, the grafted substrate was used to anchor a hydrophilic polymeric drug release system consisting of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The PVA anchored MA grafted LDPE (PVA/MA-g-LDPE) drug release system was used for the controlled release of letrozole. This system was characterized using ATR–FTIR spectrophotometry, surface profilometry, and scanning electron microscopy. Biocompatibility studies were also carried out. In vitro release studies of letrozole from the system were performed in distilled water and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at 37°C. Release of ∼90% letrozole from hydrophilic PVA matrix was observed within a period of 35 days. A high correlation coefficient (R2=0.99) was seen between the release of letrozole in distilled water and PBS. Cytotoxicity studies using MTT colorimetric assay suggested that all samples were biocompatible. It is concluded that the letrozole delivery system appears to overcome the limitations associated with letrozole by providing enhanced drug dissolution rate, controlled release and improved bioavailability of the incorporated drug and, therefore, seems to have extended therapeutic effects.}

As sperm motility is an important criterion for assessing the male fertility potential, this technique is used to study sperm cell motility behavior and rotational dynamics. Methods and Patients. An integrated optical system with near-infrared laser beam has been used to analyze rotational dynamics of live sperm cells from oligozoospermic and asthenozoospermic cases and compared with controls. Results. The linear, translational motion of the sperm is converted into rotational motion on being optically trapped, without causing any adverse effect on spermatozoa. The rotational speed of sperm cells from infertile men is observed to be significantly less as compared to controls. Conclusions. Distinguishing normal and abnormal sperm cells on the basis of beat frequency above 5.6 Hz may be an important step in modern reproductive biology to sort and select good quality spermatozoa. The application of laser-assisted technique in biology has the potential to be a valuable tool for assessment of sperm fertilization capacity for improving assisted reproductive technology.},

abstract = {Objective
Metabolic anomalies, if any, between early and late onset preeclampsia [PE] were explored using Fourier transform infrared [FTIR] spectroscopy.
Setting
Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, SSKM Hospital, IPGMER, Kolkata and Midnapur Medical College Hospital, Midnapur, India.
Sample
80 pregnant women attending routine antenatal care units; (i) early onset PE [gestational age; GA<34weeks] (ii) late onset PE [GA>34weeks] (iii) early onset control [GA 24–34weeks] and (iv) late onset control [GA>34weeks].
Methods
Serum FTIR spectra were obtained in the wave-number range of 600–4000cm−1 at 4cm−1 resolution. 1H NMR and estimation of atherosclerotic index (AI) were performed to validate the FTIR findings.
Main outcome measure(s)
Clinical characteristics and metabolic profile.
Results
13 spectral peaks corresponding to the carbohydrate, protein and lipid region were significantly altered in early onset PE [P<0.001; at 95% confidence interval]. Discriminant analysis identified five highly significant wave-numbers (1078, 1088, 1122, 1169 and 1171cm−1) having ⩾80% overall accuracy. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the obtained spectra at these 5 wave-numbers provided excellent segregation of early and late onset PE with respect to their controls. Principal component analysis revealed that these 5 wave-numbers significantly separated the two sub-groups of PE (97.95% of the total variance). 1H NMR results showed that serum levels of glutamate, choline, alanine and lactate were significantly higher while ariginine and citrate were significantly decreased in early onset PE as compared to late onset cases.
Conclusion
Our study reveals differences in metabolomic profiles of early and late onset preeclamptic cases.}

    abstract = {Poor endometrial perfusion during implantation window is reported to be one of the possible causes of idiopathic recurrent spontaneous miscarriage (IRSM). We have tested the hypothesis that certain angiogenic and vasoactive factors are associated with vascular dysfunction during implantation window in IRSM and, therefore, could play a contributory role in making the endometrium unreceptive in these women. This is a prospective case-controlled study carried out on 66 women with IRSM and age and BMI matched 50 fertile women serving as controls. Endometrial expression of pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, TGF-β1), anti-inflammatory (IL-4, -10), angiogenesis-associated cytokines (IL-2, -6, -8), angiogenic and vasoactive factors including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), nitric oxide (NO) and adrenomedullin (ADM) were measured during implantation window by ELISA. Subendometrial blood flow (SEBF) was assessed by color Doppler ultrasonography. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the significant factor(s) responsible for vascular dysfunction in IRSM women during window of implantation and further correlated with vascular dysfunction. Endometrial expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and PGE2 were up-regulated and anti-inflammatory and angiogenesis-associated cytokines down-regulated in IRSM women as compared with controls. Further, the angiogenic and vasoactive factors including VEGF, eNOS, NO and ADM were found to be down-regulated and SEBF grossly affected in these women. Multivariate analysis identified IL-10, followed by VEGF and eNOS as the major factors contributing towards vascular dysfunction in IRSM women. Moreover, these factors strongly correlated with blood flow impairment. This study provides an understanding that IL-10, VEGF and eNOS are the principal key components having a contributory role in endometrial vascular dysfunction in women with IRSM. Down-regulation of these factors is also associated with impaired endometrial perfusion which possibly makes the endometrium unreceptive that may eventually cause early pregnancy loss.},

	Abstract = {Clomiphene citrate, by stimulating the endogenous gonadotrophin secretion, reduces the dose of exogenous gonadotrophin for controlled ovarian stimulation. However, the benefit of clomiphene citrate may be offset by its oestrogen-receptor depleting effect on target tissues like endometrium. Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, stimulates endogenous gonadotrophin secretion (like clomiphene citrate). However, it does not deplete oestrogen receptors and hence does not have adverse effect on endometrium (unlike clomiphene citrate). To evaluate the effectiveness of letrozole + FSH combination versus only FSH for contolled ovarian stimulation in unexplained infertility patients undergoing intra-uterine insemination, a prospective randomised trial was undertaken among 55 patients with unexplained infertility completed all together 118 treatment cycles of controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination. All these patients were regularly ovulatory women and had folliculometry by transvaginal ultrasound scanning (without any medication) with timed intercourse for Initial 2 cycles before going for controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination. Thereafter, 29 patients, of these 55 patients, who were allotted to one group (letrozole + FSH group) started the treatment cycle of controlled ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination. For controlled ovarian stimulation, each of these 29 patients received letrozole 2.5 mg from day 3 to day 7. From day 7 onwards, each patient received FSH injection intramuscular (50-150 IU/day) until the leading follicle is &gt; or = 18 mm. Twenty-six patients, of these 55 patients, were allotted to another group (only FSH group). Each of these patients received FSH injection intramuscular (50-225 units/day) from day 3 until the leading follicle is &gt; or = 18 mm. Monitoring of follicular development was done by transvaginal ultrasound scan, first on day 2/3 of each treatment cycle, then on day 7 and thereafter on alternate day or sometimes on successive days till the leading follicle is 18 mm or more. The dose and duration of FSH was adjusted depending on the number and size of growing follicles. Injection hCG 10000 units intramuscular was administered when the leading follicle was 18 mm or more. Intra-uterine insemination was performed 36 hours following hCG administration. Urine for pregnancy test was performed 21 days later if the patient did not have period by then. In each group, the outcome measures noted are mean of total dose of FSH/cycle, total number of mature follicles (&gt; 16 mm) (on the day of hCG administration), endometrial thickness (on the day of hCG administration), and pregnancy rate/cycle. Statistical analysis was carried by using unpaired 't' test on continuous variables whereas Fisher's exact test was used on categorical variables. There was no significant difference in mean of total number of mature follicles (&gt; 16 mm) and endometrial thickness on the day of hCG administration as well as pregnancy rate/cycle between two groups. However, the mean total dose of FSH/cycle and mean total duration of FSH administration/cycle were significantly less in letrozole + FSH group compared with only FSH group.},

abstract = {Objective
To investigate differences in the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9 and their respective tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in follicular fluid of women with endometriosis, to correlate the findings with IVF outcome, and to examine the therapeutic potential of progesterone supplementation in restoring the fine balance between MMPs and TIMPs.
Design
Prospective case-control clinical study.
Setting
Infertility clinic and reproductive health research unit.
Patient(s)
A total of 340 infertile women undergoing IVF.
Intervention(s)
Natural micronized progesterone capsules were administered for luteal support.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Association of MMPs 2 and 9 and TIMP-1 with oocyte maturity and embryo development.
Result(s)
An abnormal expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 with extensive MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalance in women with endometriosis undergoing IVF was observed. Transforming growth factor β1 plays an important role in these women with possible involvement of Smad-2 and -3 proteins. Progesterone supplementation improves the imbalance in MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio significantly in women with endometriosis who conceive after IVF.
Conclusion(s)
Increase in MMP-2 and -9 and decrease in TIMP-1 expression was associated with poor oocyte and embryo development in women with endometriosis undergoing IVF. MMP-9/TIMP-1 balance was highly affected in these women, and progesterone supplementation appeared to restore this imbalance to a considerable degree.}

It is suggested that free radicals play an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. In this study we have shown that nanoceria mitigate the endometrial lesions induced in mice model by decreasing oxidative stress and inhibiting angiogenesis. Moreover, nanoceria were also observed to protect endometriosis-related adverse effects on the oocytes, which is critical for successful pregnancy. Summarizing, nanoceria have shown promising efficacy against endometriosis related pathogenesis.
From the Clinical Editor
Free radicals have been implemented in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. In a murine model the authors demonstrated successful treatment of endometriosis with nanoceria, and protection of endometriosis-related adverse effects on the oocytes, paving the way to potential clinical translational applications in the future.}

The present study focuses on the use of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy based targeted metabolite profiling approach to explore dysregulation in metabolites expression in women with endometriosis. Further, association of oxidative stress with the metabolite ensembles, if any, is investigated. Using multivariate statistics, partial least square discriminant analysis model was generated which could classify endometriosis patients with sensitivity and specificity of 92.83\% and 100\%, respectively, and with a classification rate of 96.4\%. In conjunction with increased glucose metabolism, citrate and succinate were found to be elevated in endometriosis patients. Higher levels of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and advanced oxidation protein products and lower levels of total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione were also observed. Increased glucose metabolism and defects in the mitochondrial respiratory system are suggested to be the possible sources of excessive reactive oxygen species generation in endometriosis.},

These treatment modalities have high incidence of systemic toxicity, thereby compelling clinicians to look for targeted therapy aiming specifically at the malignant cells. Bevacizumab (anti-VEGF), temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitor) and aflibercept (VEGF trap) are already under clinical trials in women with EAC. Targeting the ligands and receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily holds promise in this regard. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the various mechanisms and pathways related to the TNF superfamily involved in advanced EAC and to identify the new therapeutic strategies for specifically targeting these impaired pathways. In addition, the development of treatments for EAC is also discussed. The possible therapeutic treatments include targeting TNFα and its receptors using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) such as infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, and certolizumab. Proteosome inhibitors including bortezomib and the anti CD-20 agent rituximab are used to inhibit the NF-κB pathway. Other options include targeting the FAS (CD95) pathway and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) pathway using agents such as mapatumab, lexatumumab, and conatumumab. These pathways are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of EAC. Moreover, there is adequate evidence to warrant the use of drugs that target the TNF superfamily for the treatment of advanced EAC.}

Combinatorial therapies that target multiple signaling pathways may provide improved therapeutic responses over monotherapies. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of celecoxib and AEE788 alone and in combination on cell proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, morphological changes, actin filament organization and apoptosis induction in the human colon cancer cell lines.
Main methods
Effect of celecoxib and AEE788 alone and in combination on colon cancer cell lines was evaluated by cell proliferation assay, morphological analysis, cell cycle analysis, scratch-wound healing and chorioallantoic membrane assays, zymography, nuclear fragmentation and western blot analyses.
Key findings
Either drug alone or in combination inhibited human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines HCT 15 and HT 29 in a dose-dependent manner. Microscopic analysis revealed inhibition of cell membrane extensions, cell shrinkage, and disorganization of actin filaments. Additionally, either drug alone or in combination inhibited HCT 15 migration, invasion and angiogenesis by suppressing matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activities. Increased reactive oxygen generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cleavage of PARP, caspase-3 activation and DNA ladder formation characterized the induction of apoptosis by celecoxib and/or AEE788 treatment. Either drug individually induced apoptosis via down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bcl-xL, and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, cleavage of PARP, activation of caspase-3 and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathways.
Significance
Results indicate that AEE788 potentiates celecoxib-mediated inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis in HCT 15 colon cancer cells and may prove useful for developing a combinatorial therapy for colon cancer.}

abstract = {Objective
Surface roughness parameters of various intraocular lenses (IOLs) biomaterials using atomic force microscopy (AFM) are compared. Variation, if any, in the micro-roughness properties of different IOLs made up of the same biomaterial is also explored. Retrospective analysis of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) incidence has been followed up for a period of four years post IOL implantation to evaluate the correlation of PCO formation with surface roughness of IOLs.
Design
Experimental materials study.
Materials and participants
Surface characteristics of 20 different IOL models were assessed using AFM. These IOL models were made up of PMMA or HEMA or acrylic hydrophobic or acrylic hydrophilic or silicone. Retrospective analysis of PCO incidence in 3629 eyes of 2656 patients implanted with the same IOL models was performed.
Methods
Topological characteristics of 20 different IOLs made up of 5 different biomaterials including (i) PMMA, (ii) HEMA, (iii) acrylic hydrophobic, (iv) acrylic hydrophilic and (v) silicone were evaluated using AFM in the tapping mode. Images were acquired with a resolution of 256×256 data points per scan at a scan rate of 0.5Hz per line and a scan size of 10×10μm. Rate of PCO formation in 3629 eyes of 2656 patients implanted with the five different IOL biomaterials was retrospectively analyzed.
Results
AFM images of IOL optic surfaces showed a collection of pores, grooves, ridges and surface irregularities. Surface roughness parameters of the IOL optics were significantly different on comparing lenses of different materials. Acrylic hydrophobic IOLs had minimum surface roughness while acrylic hydrophilic IOLs showed the highest surface roughness. Different IOL models of the same biomaterial showed varied topological roughness characteristics. Retrospective analyses of PCO formation rate after IOL implantation was carried out, which revealed that rate of PCO incidence, was directly proportional to the increase in surface micro-roughness of IOLs.
Conclusions
AFM is a powerful technique for the topological characterization of IOLs. Acrylic hydrophobic IOLs showed minimum surface roughness properties as well as minimum PCO incidence over a period of four years post implantation. It is, therefore, tempting to consider acrylic hydrophobic IOLs over other IOL biomaterials as the ideal biocompatible material for lowering PCO incidence. These results suggest an urgent need for manufacturers to optimize the various steps involved in the fabrication of IOLs.}

abstract = {There is no clear acceptance of specific follicular fluid biomarker and its correlation with oocyte quality or related embryo variable till now. Most of the studies analyze correlation between certain biomolecules and the oocyte quality using single variable, instead of multivariate analysis algorithms. Our hypothesis is not based on single biomarker discovery, but attempts to explain oocyte quality in terms of energy metabolic pathways by considering its various intermediates. Reduced availability of glucose in the oocytes and follicular cells caused by defective transportation of glucose is expected in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This initiates alternative pathways to utilize fatty acid, amino acids etc. for energy as a compensatory mechanism to deal with the energy requirement. These compensations can be reflected by altered levels of various biomolecules in follicular fluid (e.g. ketone bodies, lipids, amino acids, lactate, pyruvate etc.). The amount of compensation, in order to meet the energy requirement can be directly correlated to quality of oocytes and better outcome after in vitro fertilization (IVF) in PCOS cases. This can be predicted with fair accuracy by doing a multivariate analysis of altered levels of various biomolecules in follicular fluid. Various supervised and unsupervised classification techniques based on spectroscopic data, obtained from follicular fluid samples may certainly prove to be an important tool to predict oocytes quality and IVF outcome with better accuracy in women with PCOS.}

Fertilization rate, number of good quality embryos and clinical pregnancy rates were higher in group B compared to group A, though not statistically significant. FF ROS was significantly higher and TAC significantly lower in groups A2 and B2 compared to groups A1 and B1 (p \&lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The presence of MS and oocyte maturation in PCOS women showed a positive correlation with low levels of OS.},

abstract = {Though the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in female infertility has been a subject of rigorous research worldwide, there is inadequate information on the cut-off value of ROS in the oocyte microenvironment beyond which ART outcome may be adversely affected. An upper ROS level in follicular fluid (FF) samples of women undergoing IVF beyond which good quality embryo formation is unlikely, is established. ROS, lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity were estimated. The upper cut-off ROS level beyond which viable embryo formation is not favorable was found to be ∼107cps/400μl FF. This level, determined in women with tubal factor infertility, was further validated in women with endometriosis and PCOS and correlated with fertilization and pregnancy rate and embryo quality. Summarizing, a threshold level in FF has been established for the first time beyond which ROS may be considered toxic for viable embryo formation and pregnancy outcome.}

abstract = {Analysis of changes in cancer cell morphology and cytoskeletal element induced by external stimuli is focus of current cancer chemotherapeutic studies. Cancer cell cytoskeleton is complex network of interwoven protein fibers composed of microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate filaments. These interwoven protein fibers are responsible for maintaining cell morphology, movement, adhesion and transmembrane signal transmission. In this study, morphological and cytoskeletal changes induced by AEE788 and/or Celecoxib on colon cancer cell HCT 15 were analyzed using advanced microscopic techniques. Cell proliferation assay was used for determining IC50 of AEE788 and/or Celecoxib on HCT 15. Confocal microscopic analysis of AEE788 and/or Celecoxib treated HCT 15 was performed using Rhodamine-Phalloidin (actin stain) and Hoechst 33342 (nuclear stain). Atomic force (AFM) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies were also performed to analyze cell morphology and cell wall extension (filopodia and lamellipodia). In addition, quantitative analysis of morphological parameters was studied using cellular image processing technique. This is the first report that combination of AEE788 and Celecoxib additively increase growth inhibition and cell death on human colon cancer cell HCT 15 as estimated by cell proliferation assay. Morphological analysis of AEE788 or Celecoxib treated HCT 15 cell for 24h have not revealed significant change in morphology under phase contrast microscopy. But, slight morphological changes were observed in combination (AEE788+Celecoxib) treated HCT 15 for 24h. In contrast, high resolution confocal laser fluorescence and atomic force microscopic studies have revealed cell shrinkage, disorganized actin filament and, loss of filopodia and lamellipodia. These changes were more prominent in combination of AEE788 and Celecoxib treated HCT 15 than either drug alone. These results may suggest antiproliferative and antimetastatic activity of AEE788 and/or Celecoxib. Quantitative analysis of morphological parameters using cellular image processing technique have shown decrease in mean area, perimeter, compactness and eccentricity of combination drug treated cells than either drug alone. These results further support the confocal and AFM study. Scanning electron microscopic study of AEE788 and/or Celecoxib treated HCT 15 has also shown morphological changes and loss of filopodia and lamellipodia. In conclusion, this investigation of morphological and cytoskeletal changes using advanced microscopic techniques present a significant foundation for evaluating anticancer activity of a drug and form a new strategy for evaluating effect of AEE788 and/or Celecoxib on colon cancer.}

To explore the effect of letrozole as an ovulation inducing agent on oocyte and embryo quality in mice model.
Design
Prospective study.
Setting
Institute of Reproductive Medicine, Kolkata, India.
Animal(s)
Sixty-nine sexually mature female Swiss Albino mice 6–7 weeks old.
Intervention(s)
Metaphase II (MII) oocytes from two groups of mice, one group injected with letrozole and the other with rFSH.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Number of MII oocytes, number of oocytes with meiotic spindle (MS), different angles of MS relative to the polar body (PB), spindle characteristics, and fertilization outcome.
Result(s)
The MS was present in 84% and 71.2% of the oocytes in the letrozole and rFSH group, respectively. In the letrozole group, 73% of the oocytes had a 0° spindle position compared with 35.7% in the rFSH group. With letrozole, 19% of the oocytes had 0° > MS < 90° and 8% had MS >90°, compared with 46.1% oocytes with 0° > MS < 90° and 18.2% with MS >90° with rFSH. Mean spindle area retardance, spindle dimensions, and 4–8-cell embryo formation rate were significantly higher with letrozole compared with rFSH. Two-cell and blastocyst formation rates were similar in both groups.
Conclusion(s)
Robust birefringent spindles were obtained in mice on superovulation with letrozole. Letrozole does not appear to increase the risk of spindle assembly and preimplantation developmental arrest in mouse oocytes.}
